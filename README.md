# Writing to gov and media about ILR route change

Found some links from Reddit about how to email our government and media and suggest that the change from 5 year ILR route to 10 year ILR route should not be retrospectively applied to immigrants who are already on the 5 year route.

## The basics (or "must do" items)

1. Find your March month payslips for March 2021, 2022, 2023, 2024, 2025. March month payslips should contain a "year to date" number for the total tax you've paid in that fiscal year. It should also contain the total National Insurance contributions (written as NI, NIC, etc.) you've made that year. Add them up and keep those numbers with you. Now you know how much taxes you've paid and how much NI contributions you've made. Use them in the email templates later. If you don't have payslips, check your P60 forms which will tell the taxes you've paid. P60 won't tell you about NI contributions though.

2. Email your MP. Find your MP using your post code using <https://members.parliament.uk/FindYourMP>. Some email templates:

   - [Template 1](https://old.reddit.com/r/ukvisa/comments/1kkmz18/immigration_changes_announcement_1252025/mrwscke/)
   - [Template 2](https://old.reddit.com/r/ukvisa/comments/1kkmz18/immigration_changes_announcement_1252025/mrwk4iq/)
   - [Template 3](https://old.reddit.com/r/ukvisa/comments/1kkmz18/immigration_changes_announcement_1252025/msch87n/)
   - [Template 4](https://old.reddit.com/r/ukvisa/comments/1kkmz18/immigration_changes_announcement_1252025/ms9if6e/)

   Pick one template and write your email. Don't just copy-paste the template. Personalize it for yourself.

   **NOTE:** You MUST finish your email with your full name, your full postal address with post code and your phone/mobile number. MPs have an obligation to respond to their constituents only. So they need your details to verify who you are before they can reply to you. So DO provide your full name, address and number while writing to your MP. If you've forgotten to include these details, resend your email with your full details. Otherwise they have no obligation to act on your request.

4. Email some members of the House of Lords. Find the members using <https://members.parliament.uk/members/lords>. You may need to do some research to find which member will empathize with your sentiments and write to them. So come back to this point later if you don't know who to write to. Adapt the previous template to write your email. Some folks have already written to members in the list below:

   - <https://members.parliament.uk/member/3709/contact> ([see here](https://old.reddit.com/r/ukvisa/comments/1kkmz18/immigration_changes_announcement_1252025/mt9hm3q/))
   - <https://members.parliament.uk/member/891/contact> ([see here](https://old.reddit.com/r/ukvisa/comments/1kkmz18/immigration_changes_announcement_1252025/mt9hm3q/))
   - <https://members.parliament.uk/member/1987/contact> ([see here](https://old.reddit.com/r/ukvisa/comments/1kkmz18/immigration_changes_announcement_1252025/mt9hm3q/))
   - <https://members.parliament.uk/member/2652/contact> ([see here](https://old.reddit.com/r/ukvisa/comments/1kkmz18/immigration_changes_announcement_1252025/mta3utd/))
  
   Writing to the same members again could help with showing the numbers. But it is probably better to find other members using <https://members.parliament.uk/members/lords> and write to them. Like mentioned above, this task needs research. So come back to this point later if you don't have the time now.
  
   **NOTE:** Remember to include your full name, full postal address with post code and mobile number. 

5. Someone suggested to send representation letter to Home Office. Find letter and email address here: <https://old.reddit.com/r/ukvisa/comments/1kl3bup/tell_the_home_office_not_to_apply_the_10year_ilr/>. There's too much information on that page. So let me make it easy for you. First search for "Home Department" on that page. That's where the letter starts. The creator of that letter advices you to copy the letter and then personalize the letter to reflect your factual background.

   **NOTE:** Include full name, full postal address with post code at the bottom of your letter.

   The creator of the letter advices you to email the letter to both `public.enquiries@homeoffice.gov.uk` and `immigrationpubliccorrespondence@homeoffice.gov.uk`.

8. If you live in London, write to the Mayor at `mayor@london.gov.uk`. Remember to adapt the email template from the 2nd point.

   **NOTE:** Remember to write your full name, full postal address with post code and mobile number.

11. Write to BBC at `bbcyourvoice@bbc.co.uk`. Read <https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c249ndrrd7vo> and write your email as a response to this article with your thoughts.

12. Write to the Guardian at `guardian.letters@theguardian.com`. Read one of their articles like <https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/may/13/tell-us-how-you-might-be-affected-by-labours-plans-to-reduce-migration-to-the-uk> or <https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/may/16/we-are-a-diverse-nation-not-an-island-of-strangers> and write your email as a response to it with your thoughts.

    **NOTE:** The Guardian requires your name and full postal address. They don't publish the full address though. They publish your name and your city name only.

## Extra mile

1. After writing to the MP and hopefully Home Office too, fill out the survey form that helps the community track how many people have wrote to their MPs:

   * Survey form: <https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfvgKM20uT5rKZhRBWfPmUNx_a-clEBKLZS6JE0rAAL6H8pPw/viewform>
   * Survey results: <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1f3wtNGCfxtSzdkdYOZZBexO4mAGSfOFQ8WcqwwitId0>
   * Survey info: <https://old.reddit.com/r/ukvisa/comments/1knjydy/if_youve_emailed_your_mp_please_fill_out_this/>

2. Someone suggested to visit the MPs in person in surgeries (meaning "meetings"). Check this out: <https://old.reddit.com/r/ukvisa/comments/1kkmz18/immigration_changes_announcement_1252025/mt4xzhd/>.
